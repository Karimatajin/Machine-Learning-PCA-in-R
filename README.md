# Machine-Learning-PCA-in-R

## Task

  Perform a  Principal Component Analysis of the soccer data

## Objective of PCA

 Principal Component Analysis is one of the popular algorithms in Machine Learning for exploratory analysis, it is helpful in the case of "wide" datasets
 it can be used as a dimensionality reduction method which can help to minimize the number of the variables without losing much of the original information
 there are two options to reduce dimensionality either by using feature elimination or feature extraction
